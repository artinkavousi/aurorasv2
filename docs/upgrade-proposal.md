# AuroraSV2 Upgrade Proposal

## Executive Summary
This proposal outlines a multi-phase upgrade plan to transform AuroraSV2 into a richer, faster, and more immersive real-time experience. The plan focuses on four pillars: performance optimization, visual fidelity, interactive features, and robust audio-reactive systems. Each pillar includes actionable initiatives, recommended tooling, and measurable success criteria to guide implementation.

## Current State Assessment
- **Rendering stack**: Three.js with WebGPU renderer, HDR environment lighting, bloom post-processing, MLS-MPM particle simulation, and OrbitControls-based camera.
- **Interactivity**: Pointer raycasting feeds the MLS-MPM simulator for mouse-driven interactions. Basic tweakable configuration through `conf` and `Info` panes.
- **Visuals**: HDRI-based lighting, bloom, particle/point rendering, and animated lighting rig.
- **Audio**: No built-in sound reactivity pipeline at present.
- **Performance considerations**: Deferred post-processing pipeline, dynamic particle updates, but limited batching, LOD, or simulation adaptivity.

## Goals
1. **Boost Performance & Stability**: Maintain 60+ FPS on desktop GPUs and target 30+ FPS on capable mobile devices.
2. **Elevate Visual Fidelity**: Introduce cinematic lighting, material variety, and contextual storytelling elements.
3. **Deliver Rich Interaction**: Expand input modalities, presets, and shareable states.
4. **Add Deep Audio Reactivity**: Provide configurable audio-driven modulation across visual and simulation layers.
5. **Improve Tooling & Maintainability**: Enhance testing, profiling, documentation, and deployment workflows.

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Performance Enhancements
- **GPU Profiling & Budgets**
  - Integrate WebGPU profiling hooks (e.g., `renderer.info` plus WebGPU capture tools) and establish frame budgets per subsystem.
  - Automate perf regression testing with scripted camera paths and headless captures.
- **Simulation Optimizations**
  - Implement adaptive MLS-MPM grid resolution based on camera distance/importance zones.
  - Add particle pooling and frustum/occlusion culling for render passes.
  - Allow compute shader-based simulation steps where WebGPU support is detected.
- **Renderer Optimizations**
  - Introduce dynamic resolution scaling and temporal upscaling options.
  - Use clustered/forward+ lighting for scalable light counts.
  - Cache bloom prefilters per frame and enable toggleable post-processing quality presets.
- **Asset & Build Pipeline**
  - Compress HDRI and textures via Basis/EXR->KTX2.
  - Employ code-splitting for optional controls (Tweakpane, Info overlays) and lazy-load heavy modules (e.g., MLS-MPM debug views).

### 2. Visual Fidelity Upgrades
- **Lighting & Atmospherics**
  - Add volumetric light shafts using raymarching nodes or signed distance fields.
  - Integrate dynamic sky/aurora shaders with procedural noise layers and time-of-day progression.
- **Material Diversity**
  - Support hybrid particle rendering: sprites, metaball surfaces via marching cubes, and screen-space fluid rendering for dramatic splashes.
  - Introduce surface decals and ground-plane parallax effects to anchor the scene.
- **Camera & Presentation**
  - Implement guided camera paths, cinematic intro/outro sequences, and keyframe-based transitions.
  - Add UI controls for aspect ratios, color grading LUTs, and screenshot/video export.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**
  - Redesign overlay with minimalistic glassmorphism aesthetic, responsive layout, and contextual tooltips.
  - Include preset gallery thumbnails and descriptions for quick scene swaps.

### 3. Interaction & Feature Expansion
- **Input Modalities**
  - Support multi-touch gestures (pinch, rotate), gamepad control mapping, and optional Leap Motion integration.
  - Add MIDI/OSC input adapters for live performances.
- **Preset & State Management**
  - Build a JSON-based preset system capturing lighting, simulation, and audio mappings.
  - Enable QR/shareable URLs using query params or hash routing, leveraging Vite dynamic imports for preset bundles.
- **Collaboration & Live Mode**
  - Create a “performance mode” with networked control via WebSockets, allowing remote parameter tweaking.
  - Expose read-only spectator view optimized for streaming with OBS overlays.

### 4. Audio-Reactivity System
- **Audio Pipeline**
  - Implement Web Audio API graph with FFT analysis, beat detection, and multi-band envelope followers.
  - Allow microphone input, local file playback, and live stream sources (WebRTC).
- **Mapping Layer**
  - Design a node-based modulation system (e.g., using Tweakpane plugins) to route audio features to scene parameters.
  - Provide presets for common mappings (bass-driven bloom, midrange particle spawn, treble color shifts).
- **Visualization Feedback**
  - Add spectrum analyzers, waveform overlays, and debug monitoring for sound reactivity tuning.
- **Performance Considerations**
  - Run analysis in AudioWorklets where supported to avoid UI thread stalls.
  - Offer quality levels (FFT size, smoothing) and fallback to minimal reactive cues on low-power devices.

### 5. Tooling, Testing, and Deployment
- **Developer Tooling**
  - Add ESLint + Prettier, TypeScript migration roadmap, and automated lint/test scripts.
  - Introduce Storybook or isolated playgrounds for shaders/materials.
- **Testing & CI/CD**
  - Configure CI for build, lint, and WebGL/WebGPU smoke tests using headless Chromium.
  - Add visual regression testing via Playwright screenshots against golden baselines.
- **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing**
  - Expand docs with architecture diagrams, shader overviews, and “how-to” guides for presets and audio mappings.
  - Record short Loom-style walkthroughs embedded in docs for onboarding.
- **Deployment & Distribution**
  - Create staging/production pipelines with Vercel/Netlify, including feature flag toggles.
  - Package desktop kiosk builds using Electron/Tauri for installations.

## Roadmap & Milestones
1. **Phase 0 – Foundations (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Set up linting/formatting, profiling tools, and documentation scaffolding.
   - Audit current performance metrics to establish baselines.
2. **Phase 1 – Performance & Stability (Weeks 3-6)**
   - Implement adaptive simulation, culling, and post-processing quality presets.
   - Integrate automated performance regression tests.
3. **Phase 2 – Visual & UI Refresh (Weeks 5-9)**
   - Deploy new UI design, camera presets, and enhanced lighting/atmospherics.
   - Add material variety and screen-space effects.
4. **Phase 3 – Audio Reactivity (Weeks 8-12)**
   - Build audio pipeline, mapping system, and preset library.
   - Expose controls via revamped UI and document workflows.
5. **Phase 4 – Interaction & Live Features (Weeks 11-16)**
   - Add advanced input support, collaboration mode, and sharing features.
   - Prepare performance mode tooling and network control surfaces.
6. **Phase 5 – Polish & Release (Weeks 15-18)**
   - Conduct user testing, refine presets, and finalize documentation.
   - Launch updated experience with marketing assets (videos, social content).

## Success Metrics
- Maintain >= 90th percentile frame time under 16.6 ms on target hardware profiles.
- Increase average session duration and preset usage via analytics instrumentation.
- Achieve positive qualitative feedback on visual/audio immersion from beta testers.
- Deliver comprehensive documentation coverage (>90% modules) and onboarding satisfaction.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **WebGPU Browser Support**: Provide WebGL fallback paths and progressive enhancement.
- **Audio Input Permissions**: Offer clear UX prompts and fallback to preloaded tracks.
- **Complexity Creep**: Enforce milestone scoping, use feature flags, and maintain modular architecture.
- **Performance Regression**: Leverage CI performance tests and maintain baseline comparison dashboards.

## Conclusion
By executing this roadmap, AuroraSV2 can evolve into a high-performance, visually stunning, and sonically immersive experience suitable for live shows, installations, and online showcases. The proposal balances ambitious feature growth with pragmatic engineering practices to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability.
